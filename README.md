# assembler-with-MIPS-instructions
A simple assembler with MIPS instructions. It can transform MIPS instructions to binary codes.


1. Create an assembly code file, new.S. (MIPS formation; Please take a look on the new.S; The assembly code file name must be new.S, or it can't find the file)
2. Type "make all" in Terminal to generate the executable file, named "proj"
3. Type PC value in hex
4. Type $sp value in hex
5. Type how many words do you want in dimage.bin() (0~256)
6. The words in dimage.bin will be random number
7. The iimage.bin and dimage.bin will be generated. (Everything printed in machine_code_gen is just for debugging. You could just ignore it!)
